Welcome to the [YOCaml](https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml) Users **Webring**
(this is an example of how to build web pages that are a bit different from
classical blogs). The CSS is really sad and very little of the metadata is used
ðŸ¤ . When your site is added to the list, you can use the following links to
navigate between the different addresses in the ring:

- `{webring-address}/{your-ident}/prev/` to reach the previous website
- `{webring-address}/{your-ident}/succ/` to reach the next website
