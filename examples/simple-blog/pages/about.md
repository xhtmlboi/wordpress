This is an example application using **YOCaml 2**! The aim of this blog is to
show you how to quickly build a **full-featured blog** based on the new version of
YOCaml (using _archetypes_). 

> The fact that this is a sample blog justifies the violently generated (and
> completely uninteresting) articles. Sorry about that!

You can refer to the [code of this
project](https://gitlab.com/funkywork/yocaml/-/blob/main/examples/simple-blog/bin/simple_blog.ml?ref_type=heads)
to see how to build a _blog_ **yourself** using, for example, [this
template](https://github.com/xvw/yocaml2-empty-template) that allows you to
bootstrap an empty project filled with YOCaml dependencies.
